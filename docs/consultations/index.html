The trick is to get the skills and support you need to willingly participate in the process and to turn the negative into an opportunity for growth. I believe that you, the client, are the expert in your life. You are here to identify and nourish your strengths, to harness your inner power and direction, to hear your soul's call... then you will create a meaningful life, one full of joy, purpose and creativity. Human beings are complex. To heal and grow at a deep level it is vital that the 4 cornerstones of our essential nature are brought into balance: emotional, physical, mental and spiritual. My sacred task is to assist and support you on your journey.</p><h2>Tools in my healers basket / kete</h2><ul><li>Interactive Drawing Therapy (trained to Master level) – used in clinical supervision and counselling</li><li>Motivational Interviewing - excellent for working with ambivalence / inner conflict / addictions</li><li>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy - thoughts create things</li><li>Mindfulness - Hakomi techniques, Holistic Clearing Meditations by Ven.

I have found Ana to be a well informed and compassionate professional who brings a warmth to her work whilst maintaining sound ethical and professional boundaries. Through our ever exploratory supervision sessions I have experienced significant professional and personal developments which fulfil both my professional and personal requirements for supervision.<br>I would not hesitate to recommend her for clinical supervision.</p><footer><cite class="reviewer">Tom - Auckland</cite></footer></blockquote></div><div class="hreview"><span class="item element-invisible"><span class="fn">Ana Dorrington</span></span> <span class="rating element-invisible">5</span><blockquote><p class="description">I've been seeing Ana for 18 months now and I find her to be very trustworthy, honest and she has helped me therapeutically as well as spiritually. Counselling has helped me to work through major anxiety and depression associated with trauma and this has helped me gain control over my drinking which has been a problem all my adult life. I would recommend Ana to anyone who needs help.</p><footer><cite class="reviewer">Brett - Auckland</cite></footer></blockquote></div><div class="hreview"><span class="item element-invisible"><span class="fn">Ana Dorrington</span></span> <span class="rating element-invisible">5</span><blockquote><p class="description">I would wholeheartedly recommend Ana as a therapist to anyone who is serious about about tackling the big issues that one has to deal with which may be holding them back from fully experiencing a happy and healthy life. I first came to see Ana as a broken spirit, lost and insecure about myself and my future. Ana gets to the core of the issue with precision. With her kind and empathic ear, and methods of healing she has introduced into my life I have been transformed and empowered to take responsibility for my own healing. I have gained an understanding of my past traumas and been able to process the pain safely with Ana's direction and support. Ana is truly a treasure, and I will be forever grateful for the tools she taught me to deal with my issues.</p><footer><cite class="reviewer">Alaina - Auckland</cite></footer></blockquote></div><div class="hreview"><span class="item element-invisible"><span class="fn">Ana Dorrington</span></span> <span class="rating element-invisible">5</span><blockquote><p class="description">Ana has played such an essential part in my journey towards healing and recovery. I first came into her office very anxious and unhappy and needing help. And from that first session she has provided that help, with CBT and Interactive Drawing, as well as lots of conversations. She has shown me new ways of understanding my childhood memories and trauma and also how those experiences can affect adulthood. Thank you so much Ana, I would not be the person I am today without you and I am truly thankful.</p><footer><cite class="reviewer">Eleanor - Auckland</cite></footer></blockquote></div><div class="hreview"><span class="item element-invisible"><span class="fn">Ana Dorrington</span></span> <span class="rating element-invisible">5</span><blockquote><p class="description">When I started counselling with Ana I was at rock bottom and hopelessly stuck there. While always gentle, generous, and compassionate she knew just when to challenge me and I believe this to be the catalyst for change in my outlook and in my life as it opened up the way for new perception. She is a highly-skilled practitioner and I would warmly recommend her to anyone who is seeking to make sense of their life, emotions and behaviours.</p><footer><cite class="reviewer">Ange - Golden Bay</cite></footer></blockquote></div><div class="hreview"><span class="item element-invisible"><span class="fn">Ana Dorrington</span></span> <span class="rating element-invisible">5</span><blockquote><p class="description">I feel like you have spoken to my spirit, not in a weird way, but that you truly understand where I'm at.

I first came to her suffering from severe depression, anxiety and PTSD. During our time together there was sadness, tears and joy, and eventually acceptance and recovery. And while I will always have those trauma related issues, Ana taught me how to cope, how to put aside the grief and loss and to accept who I am without blame and self recrimination. I will always be grateful for her professionalism, life experience, caring, tough love and her deep committment to my healing. I would recommend Ana as a counsellor to anyone in need. Kia kaha and arohanui Ana.</p><footer><cite class="reviewer">Ruth - Nelson</cite></footer></blockquote></div><div class="hreview"><span class="item element-invisible"><span class="fn">Ana Dorrington</span></span> <span class="rating element-invisible">5</span><blockquote><p class="description">I found Ana to be both professional and refreshing in her approach and appreciated her down to earth manner. Ana is a skilled counsellor and has the ability to draw on a vast range of techniques which were appropriate to my cultural, spiritual and personal beliefs.
